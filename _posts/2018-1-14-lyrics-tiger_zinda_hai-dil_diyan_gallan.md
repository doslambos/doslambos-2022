My mom first told me about this song, and it's a love song so I wanted to see what it means.

This is a song written in Punjabi.  Vishal-Shekhar wrote this song, and that duo has made some very awesome songs, I would love to learn about their creative process some time.  The singer is Aatif Aslam, whose _dard bhara_ voice pulls at heart strings the world over. 

> kachchi Doriyon, Doriyon, Doriyon se <br/>
> mainu tu baandh le

with soft, raw threads, <br/>
bind me

> pakki yaariyon, yaariyon, yaariyon mein <br/>
> honde na faasley

in true frienships, <br/>
there are no distances

> eh naraazgi kaagzi saari teri <br/>
> mere soNeya sun le meri <br/>
> dil diyaan gallaan

this anger of yours is paper <br/>
honey, listen to my <br/>
heart chat

> karaange naal naal bai ke <br/>
> ankh naale ankh nu milaa ke <br/>
> dil diyan gallan haaye,

together we will sit, <br/>
eye will meet eye, and <br/>
our hearts will chat

> karaange roz roz beh ke <br/>
> sachchiyaan mohabbataan nibha ke

talks of our hearts,
we'd have everyday,
living in true love.



sataaye mainu kyun
dikhaaye mainu kyun
aiven jhooTi mooTi rus ke rusaa ke

why do you torment me,
why do you fake all this anger.

dil diyan gallan haaye
karaange naal naal beh ke
ankh naale ankh nu mila ke

tenu lakhaan ton chhupa ke rakhaan
ankkhaan te sajaa ke 
tu ae meri wafaa
rakh apna bana ke
main tere layiaan
tere layiaan yaaran
naa paavin kade dooriyaan

I'd keep you hidden from millions,
keep you adorned in my eyes, 
you are my love,
keep me as your own.
I'm for you, for you, O beloved.
Let's never be far away.

main jeena haan tera
main jeena haan tera
tu jeena hai mera
das laiNa ki nakhra dikha ke

I'm your life,
and you're my life.
what'd we get by throwing tantrums for each other.

dil diyan gallan
karaange naal naal beh ke
akh naale akh nu mila ke

dil diyan gallan

raataan kaaliyan, kaaliyan, kaaliyan ne
mere dil saanwle
mere haaNiyan, haaNiyaan, haaNiyaan je
lagge tu na gale

the nights are dark and my heart goes dark too,
if, my beloved, you don't embrace me.

mere aasmaan mausaman di na sune
koi khwaab na poora bune

my skies don't listen to the weathers,
and no dream gets weaved completely.

dil diyan gallaan
karange naal naal beh ke
ankh naal ankh nu mila ke

pataa hai mainu kyun
chhupa ke dekhe tu
mere naam se naam mila ke

I know why, in hiding,
you write our names and look at them together.

dil diyan gallaan
karaange naal naal beh ke
ankh naal ankh nu mila ke

dil diyaan gallaan...
